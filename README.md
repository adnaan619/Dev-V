# CutiCare

A Flutter project that allows the user to diagnose the five most prevalent skin diseases.

## Overview
The major goal of the project was to develop a cross-platform skin disease detection mobile application that could identify up to three prevalent skin diseases using deep learning. Our team was able to cover 5 skin illnesses using the DermNet dataset along with the transfer learning approach with ResNet-50 model, achieving a 60 percent accuracy.
TensorFlow, a Python package, was used along with several other machine learning libraries, such as NumPy, Keras, and Pandas, which helped in the model's construction.
